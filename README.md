I am a graduate student at Kyung Hee University, South Korea in the department of Artifcial Intelligence, and am currently doing research in PerCV Lab under the supervision of Professor Lee Seungkyu.

I am also a student member of Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).

You can reach out to me by my email at (wajahat@khu.ac.kr) or (wajahatalikhan@acm.org).

My research interests include Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision and Multimodality.
