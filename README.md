ðŸ‘‹ Hello , ì•ˆë…•í•˜ì„¸ìš” , Ø§Ù„Ø³Ù„Ø§Ù… Ø¹Ù„ÛŒÚ©Ù…

I am Wajahat Ali Khan, born and raised in Peshawar. I did my B.Sc in Electrical Engineering (Communication) from UET Peshawar, Pakistan and also did my initial internships and training at different kind of research centers there like NCAI (National Center of Artificial Intelligence) and NCCS (National Center of Cyber Security). 

Currently I am a graduate student at Kyung Hee University, South Korea in the department of Artifcial Intelligence, and am doing research in [PerCV Lab](https://cvlab.khu.ac.kr/) under the supervision of [Professor Lee Seungkyu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3Pf6C6cAAAAJ&hl=en).

I am a student member of Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and a member of Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC).

My research interests include Deep Learning, Multimodal Learning (CV & NLP) and Medical Imaging.

*I also sometimes write [blogs](https://wajahat-alikhan.github.io/blog/).*
