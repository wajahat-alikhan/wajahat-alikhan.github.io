I am Wajahat Ali Khan, born and raised in Peshawar. I did my B.Sc in Electrical Engineering (Communication) from UET Peshawar, Pakistan and also did my initial internships and training at different kind of research labs there like NCAI and NCCS. 

Currently I am a graduate student at Kyung Hee University, South Korea in the department of Artifcial Intelligence, and am doing research in PerCV Lab under the supervision of Professor Lee Seungkyu.

I am also a student member of Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).
